# classifiers-comparison

**Overview**

This project is focused on analyzing the labeled data of wine quality and building a prediction model for the quality of the wine. The repository contains several components such as 
data preprocessing, models, ensembling, a model selection that can be clubbed together to form the overall prediction algorithm.




**Data**

The wine quality dataset can be obtained at [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
The wine dataset is available in the form of two CSV files viz., 'winequality-red.csv' and 'winequality-white.csv.' To begin with, store these files under the dataset directory. 
To have a larger dataset, the above two data files can be combined by adding an extra feature representing the color of the wine.
