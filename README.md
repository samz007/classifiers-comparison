# classifiers-comparison

**Overview**

This project is focused at analyzing the labelled data of wine quality and building a prediction model for quality of the wine. The repository contains several components such as 
data preprocessing, models, ensembling, model selection that can be clubbed together to form overall prediction algorithm.




**Data**

The wine quality dataset can be obtained at [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
The wine dataset is available in form of two csv files viz., winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv. To begin with store these files under dataset directory. 
To build a larger dataset, these two datasets can be combined by adding an extra feature representing the color of the wine.
